Welcome to my Github Page! 

I’m currently pursuing a software engineering training course at Per Scholas in New York. 
Before this course, I worked in multiple marketing roles in publishing, hospitality and entertainment. 
When I complete the course in July 2021 I will have experience working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React. 

I’m looking forward to connecting with you to discuss how I can become a valueable part of your development team.
