Welcome to my Github Page! 

I’m currently pursuing a software engineering training course at Per Scholas in New York. 
Before this course, I worked in multiple marketing roles in publishing, hospitality and entertainment. 
When I complete the course in July 2021 I will have experience working with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and React. 

I’m looking forward to connecting with you to discuss how I can become a valueable part of your development team.


### MODULE 1 - THE GAME PROJECT

Memory Game 

This is a two-player Memory Game also known as Concentration game, Matching Pairs, Match Match and etc. While playing a game user will learn about and see the art work of PhoebeNewYork - a well-known NY street artist. 

This game was built using Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Win-state: half of the board matched by one of the Players | Loss-state: another Player wins

Approach:
1 - Wireframe and Pseudocode (logic, wining state, losing state, updating the score, error alerts)
2 - Using standard playing cards when working on the code and it’s components, not working on the style and individual game idea until the game begins working
3 - Playing the game and checking the code with all possible win/lose/draw scenarios to unfold bugs and improve the code
4 - Connecting the concept and finding required images of the artwork for the Street Art game
5 - Styling 
6 - Final run and deployment to Github.

Installation Instructions: Chrome browser, no installation required.

Methods and used in the code:
- push()
- querySelector()
- setAttribute()
- getAttribute()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- Math.random()
- Math.floor()
- setTimeout()
- addEventListener()
- removeEventListener()
- For Loops
- and more

Future plans:

1. Additional levels and additional game themes (by artist, by matching difficulty)
2. Allow for the Player 2 to be another computer or another person online
3. Improve code and find new ways to make the game more exciting and fun for the user
