<h3>Learn about NY street art while playing!</h3>
<p id="maintext"> From the streets of New York City to Philadelphia, L.A., London, and Berlin, NYC-based artist Libby Schoettle aka Phoebe reveals her own vulnerability, raw emotions, and witty observations through her alter-ego PhoebeNewYork‘s dark and funny explorations into love, feminism, political independence, and finding beauty in the mistaken. Unique street art iterations of Phoebe—a paper doll-like character collaged together with pieces of vintage photographs, fashion magazine pages, clothing, old books, and pop art—can be spotted on buildings, street lamps, and city scaffolding.
